# Animal Respawn Time Mod
This mod makes animals' respawn times in days adjustable through ModSettings.  
# Description
You can also open the json which this mod creates in the Mods folder, where you can set values which exceed the ModSettings limits.  
I originally made this mod, to set the respawn times really high, so there is need to hunt in other regions.  
I dont know the exact vanilla values specific to the difficulty settings, so be aware: this mod overrides all of them (except the cougar) to the mod's set values.  
# Installation 
Download and install the dependancy mod: ModSettings  
Download and place the dll file into your \Mods folder.  
Customize the values in the ModSettings menu or in the Json file (Mods folder).  
v1.1.0 produces a new Json file, you can delete the old AnimalRespawnTimeTweaks file.
